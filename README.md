# GradeCalculator
The Grade Calculator has two modes, final grade needed and current grade.
THe user inputs their grades and the corresponding weights of the grade, and the program will calculate a result based on what mode the user chose.

Updates to come: a way to put subject/course names and save/update results.

UPDATE 11/21/24: Added input validation and enables user to use the program multiple times.
